# Signs of Spring: Charting Seasonal Shifts Through Urban Wildlife in Philadelphia


For this project, I was interested in exploring the relationship between seasonal temperature changes and the appearance of species commonly associated with spring in Philadelphia. In order to explore this question I turned to the urban wildlife in Philadelphia County, specifically, when commonly seen animals like Red-winged Blackbirds, Groundhogs, and American Robins begin to appear. These species are often considered informal indicators of seasonal change, mentioned in everything from Indigenous knowledge to things I have heard growing up or learned in school. I wanted to see whether I could create a data visualization that would support what people already seem to sense: that nature, not the calendar, tells us when spring has arrived.

By combining 2024 iNaturalist sightings with NOAA daily temperature data, I looked for patterns between warmer days and spikes in animal observations. I wasn’t just interested in verifying a hypothesis — I wanted to understand how our everyday experience of changing seasons might align with broader ecological rhythms. Can animals serve as signs of spring in a way that complements both science and culture?









## Methodology

To explore the relationship between temperature patterns and early spring wildlife activity, I gathered data from two sources: iNaturalist and NOAA. I requested all 2024 wildlife observation records for Philadelphia County from iNaturalist, and climate data for the same region and time period from NOAA. After downloading the datasets, I worked in Excel to clean and organize the data. The iNaturalist dataset came as a raw spreadsheet, with each row representing a single observation. However, this didn’t include daily totals. Instead, I used excel formulas to calculate the number of sightings per species per day so I could line it up directly with daily temperature data from NOAA. The NOAA dataset included only daily high and low temperatures, so I added a new column to calculate the daily average temperature. This allowed for a more direct and meaningful comparison with the wildlife activity data. After cleaning up all the data, I turned the excel sheets in CSV files and uploaded them to Flourish, a platform that allows me to create interactive visualizations. In Flourish, I messed with the settings to create four visualizations: three comparing temperatures and species sightings for Red-winged Blackbirds, American Robins, and Groundhogs, and the fourth to compare the first arrival dates between these three species. 





## Species and Temperature Patterns

###  Red-winged Blackbird

Red-winged Blackbirds *(Agelaius phoeniceus)* are common across much of North America, particularly in wetlands, meadows, and marshy urban edges. They are migratory in the northern part of their range but present year-round in the south.
