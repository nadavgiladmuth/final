# Spring Watchers: Charting Seasonal Shifts Through Urban Wildlife in Philadelphia

Each year, as winter recedes, familiar animals return to Philadelphia — the Red-winged Blackbird’s trills pierce the still air, Robins hop across melting lawns, and Groundhogs emerge from hibernation. This project explores these species as **seasonal indicators**, proposing that urban wildlife can reflect ecological transitions.

While **Punxsutawney Phil** gets the fanfare each February 2nd, real Groundhogs wait until spring *actually* arrives. With iNaturalist and NOAA data, this essay asks:  
**_Can we use common urban species to measure the arrival of spring in Philadelphia?_**

## Methodology

Using 2024 data, I focused on three species:

- **Red-winged Blackbird** (*Agelaius phoeniceus*)  
- **Groundhog** (*Marmota monax*)  
- **American Robin** (*Turdus migratorius*)  

From iNaturalist, I extracted all 2024 Philadelphia County observations and counted how often each species was seen per day. Then, I added daily temperature records from the NOAA Climate Data Online tool. Using Excel, I:

- Standardized dates across both datasets  
- Aggregated species counts by day  
- Calculated average daily temperatures (mean of max and min)  
- Joined species and weather data  
- Created interactive line charts using **Flourish**

All visualizations are embedded below.

## Species and Temperature Patterns

### Red-winged Blackbird vs. Temperature

Red-winged Blackbirds were among the first to return in February — their early arrival closely follows the first upward spikes in temperature.

### Groundhog vs. Temperature

Groundhog observations lagged behind the birds, rising notably in late March and April — showing their emergence is linked to **sustained warming**.

### American Robin vs. Temperature

Robins returned in waves starting in March, corresponding with warming trends and likely linked to increasing insect availability.

### Comparing All Species

In this comparison, you can see:
- Blackbirds arriving first
- Robins peaking in mid-spring
- Groundhogs increasing steadily into late spring

Together, they illustrate a **staggered biological response** to changing conditions.

## Interpretation and Context

This work falls within **phenology**, the study of how life cycles are timed with seasons. While climate change accelerates and shifts these cycles, local data can still reveal rich seasonal patterns. These species serve as accessible indicators for city dwellers to watch — grounded in science but visible without instruments.

Rather than relying solely on folklore (sorry, Phil), this project shows:
- **Birds respond to early warmth**
- **Groundhogs emerge once consistent warming arrives**
- **Wildlife patterns track real environmental cues**

## Conclusion

This project frames everyday animals as **phenological clues** — like stopwatches tuned to temperature. By tracking their appearances alongside weather data, we gain both insight and wonder: the changing seasons are written into the lives of our neighbors, feathered and furred.
