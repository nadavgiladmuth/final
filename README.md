# Signs of Spring: Charting Seasonal Shifts Through Urban Wildlife in Philadelphia


For this project, I was interested in exploring the relationship between seasonal temperature changes and the appearance of species commonly associated with spring in Philadelphia. In order to explore this question I turned to the urban wildlife in Philadelphia County, specifically, when commonly seen animals like Red-winged Blackbirds, Groundhogs, and American Robins begin to appear. These species are often considered informal indicators of seasonal change, mentioned in everything from Indigenous knowledge to things I have heard growing up or learned in school. I wanted to see whether I could create a data visualization that would support what people already seem to sense: that nature, not the calendar, tells us when spring has arrived.

By combining 2024 iNaturalist sightings with NOAA daily temperature data, I looked for patterns between warmer days and spikes in animal observations. I wasn’t just interested in verifying a hypothesis — I wanted to understand how our everyday experience of changing seasons might align with broader ecological rhythms. Can animals serve as signs of spring in a way that complements both science and culture?









## Methodology

To explore the relationship between temperature patterns and early spring wildlife activity, I gathered data from two sources: iNaturalist and NOAA. I requested all 2024 wildlife observation records for Philadelphia County from iNaturalist, and climate data for the same region and time period from NOAA. After downloading the datasets, I worked in Excel to clean and organize the data. The iNaturalist dataset came as a raw spreadsheet, with each row representing a single observation. However, this didn’t include daily totals. Instead, I used excel formulas to calculate the number of sightings per species per day so I could line it up directly with daily temperature data from NOAA. The NOAA dataset included only daily high and low temperatures, so I added a new column to calculate the daily average temperature. This allowed for a more direct and meaningful comparison with the wildlife activity data. After cleaning up all the data, I turned the excel sheets in CSV files and uploaded them to Flourish, a platform that allows me to create interactive visualizations. In Flourish, I messed with the settings to create four visualizations: three comparing temperatures and species sightings for Red-winged Blackbirds, American Robins, and Groundhogs, and the fourth to compare the first arrival dates between these three species. 





## Species and Temperature Patterns

###  Red-winged Blackbird

Red-winged Blackbirds *(Agelaius phoeniceus)* are common across much of North America, particularly in wetlands, meadows, and marshy urban edges. They are migratory in the northern part of their range but present year-round in the south.

In this graph, you can see Red-winged Blackbird sightings begin to rise steadily in March with the first observation recorded in Philadelphia County on March 19th, closely following the seasonal increase in average temperature.  We can see as temperatures begin increasing through March and into April, the number of Red-winged Blackbirds steadily rises, suggesting a strong positive correlation between these two variables.

###  Groundhog 

Groundhogs *(Marmota monax)*, also known as woodchucks, are found throughout the eastern and central United States, often in grassy fields, forest edges, and urban green spaces. They hibernate through winter and re-emerge in the Spring when the ground begins to thaw.

In this graph we can observe that the first groundhog sighting in Philadelphia County occurred on April 7th, slightly after the increase of temperatures in March. While there are less observations of groundhogs to provide a more substantial trend, this still suggests that there is a correlation in the  increase in temperatures and groundhog sightings over a similar range of dates.

### American Robin


American Robins *(Turdus migratorius)* are widespread across the U.S. and Canada and are well-known for their adaptability to suburban and urban environments. While some overwinter in southern regions, many robins migrate north in early spring, appearing just in time for Spring.

In this graph, March 5th marks the first sighting of an American Robin in Philadelphia County. This graph depicts the strongest correlation between increasing temperatures and Robin sightings, with the increased temperature dates directly mirroring the increased number of Robin sightings. This pattern suggests that Robins may be one of the more reliable biological indicators for the beginning of Spring temperatures.
